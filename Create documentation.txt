And Finally we should create a simple UI with 1 text field.
Apply regex validation for this field on input or submit event.  Which steps I need to do ?

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's create a simple React UI to capture user input and validate it using our regex function. We'll take the following steps:

Set Up the React Component Structure
Add State Management using React Hooks
Handle the Input and Submit Events
Display the Validation Result
Step 1: Set Up the React Component Structure

Create a new component called RegexValidator:

javascript
Copy code
// RegexValidator.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function RegexValidator() {
    // ... we'll add our logic here

    return (
        <div className="validator-container">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your text" />
            <button>Validate</button>
            {/* We'll display the result here */}
        </div>
    );
}

export default RegexValidator;
Step 2: Add State Management using React Hooks

We'll use the useState hook to manage the user's input and the validation result:

javascript
Copy code
const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
const [validationResult, setValidationResult] = useState(null);
Step 3: Handle the Input and Submit Events

We'll update the inputValue state whenever the user types in the input box and call our validation function on the button click:

javascript
Copy code
function handleInputChange(e) {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);
}

function handleSubmit() {
    const result = isValidString(inputValue, 30);  // assuming max length is 30 for this example
    setValidationResult(result);
}
Now, bind these functions to the corresponding elements:

javascript
Copy code
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
<button onClick={handleSubmit}>Validate</button>
Step 4: Display the Validation Result

After validating the user input, display the result below the button:

javascript
Copy code
{validationResult !== null && (
    <p>{validationResult ? "Valid input" : "Invalid input"}</p>
)}
Bringing it All Together - Complete RegexValidator.js

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function RegexValidator() {
    const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
    const [validationResult, setValidationResult] = useState(null);

    function handleInputChange(e) {
        setInputValue(e.target.value);
    }

    function handleSubmit() {
        const result = isValidString(inputValue, 30);
        setValidationResult(result);
    }

    return (
        <div className="validator-container">
            <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your text" value={inputValue} onChange={handleInputChange} />
            <button onClick={handleSubmit}>Validate</button>
            {validationResult !== null && (
                <p>{validationResult ? "Valid input" : "Invalid input"}</p>
            )}
        </div>
    );
}

export default RegexValidator;
Finally, use the RegexValidator component in your main App.js (or wherever you want to display it) and make sure to import it:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import RegexValidator from './RegexValidator';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <RegexValidator />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Now, when you run your React app, you should see the input field and the validation button. Whenever you submit the form, it should display whether the input is valid or not based on the regex criteria we set earlier.

Let's make it more happier and add the css
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Styling can indeed make our UI more appealing and user-friendly. Here's a simple CSS style for our RegexValidator:

App.css

css
Copy code
.App {
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    height: 100vh;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: #f7f7f7;
}

.validator-container {
    background-color: #ffffff;
    padding: 40px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
    width: 300px;
    text-align: center;
}

input[type="text"] {
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    border-radius: 4px;
    font-size: 16px;
}

button {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    border: none;
    color: white;
    font-size: 16px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.3s;
}

button:hover {
    background-color: #45a049;
}

p {
    margin-top: 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
}

p:not([valid]) {
    color: red;
}

p[valid="true"] {
    color: green;
}
Now, update the RegexValidator component to utilize the valid attribute for better feedback on the validation result:

jsx
Copy code
{/* ... */}
{validationResult !== null && (
    <p valid={validationResult.toString()}>{validationResult ? "Valid input" : "Invalid input"}</p>
)}
{/* ... */}
With the CSS in place:

The main UI is centered.
The input box and button have a clearer, more accessible design.
There's visual feedback on validation. Green for valid input, red for invalid.
You can, of course, customize the colors and styles as you see fit, but this should give you a decent starting point for your UI.

And now the final step:
Update Readme.md with

Information on how to run the developed application locally.

Information on how to run the test function locally.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's go step by step:

README.md

Application Description
This application offers a user-friendly interface for validating strings based on specific criteria. Users can input their text into a dedicated field and, upon submission, the application will check its conformity to predetermined standards, offering instant feedback on the validity of the input.

Regex Implementation Description
The core functionality of this application relies on a regular expression designed to validate strings based on a few parameters. The regex ensures that the string is within an acceptable length range and contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character from a predefined list. Additionally, the regex checks for the absence of whitespace characters, ensuring a more refined input quality. It's optimized for speed and simplicity while guaranteeing a robust validation mechanism.

How to Run the Developed Application Locally
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd YourProjectName
Install the required dependencies:
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:
sql
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. The application should be running.
How to Run the Test Function Locally
Once you have the application running locally:

Open the browser console. You can typically do this by right-clicking on the web page, selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element", and then navigating to the "Console" tab.
In the application, after entering a string into the text field, click the "Validate" button.
The validation result, as well as the results of the individual test cases (if you've chosen to execute them on button click), will be displayed in the console.
This structure provides a clear and concise overview of the application, its core functionalities, and instructions on how to set up and run both the app and its tests. You can adjust the content according to any additional features or specifics of your project.

But this step actually not displaying, am I right ?
The validation result, as well as the results of the individual test cases (if you've chosen to execute them on button click), will be displayed in the console.
ChatGPT
You're right, based on the previous steps we provided, the results are being displayed on the UI and not in the browser console. Let's correct that section.

Here's the revised section for "How to Run the Test Function Locally":

How to Run the Test Function Locally
Once you have the application running locally:

In the application's UI, you will find a text input field.
Enter your string into this field.
Click the "Validate" button below the input field.
The validation result will be displayed right below the button, indicating whether the input meets the criteria or not.
You can replace the earlier section in the README.md with the revised one. My apologies for the oversight, and thank you for catching that!
